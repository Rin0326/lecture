the visionn of sciense is different due to their calture.

⇨sructured knowledge on the "pthosical world" associated to universal methods (observation/experiment)


History

what is the computer sciense ? 

computing 
- A science
- techonology
- applications
- social impact

computer Science
- Concepts :
    - infrmation
    - algorithm
    - programming language
    - architecture (computing engine)

- Methods
 back and forth between theory and experimentation, Automatic abstractiom transform, self-generated tools

- Human organization


not only informatics requires to extend the usual classifications of sciences to include analytic a posterior sciences,

K.R.Popper is important


Aciencce : A social object 

- individual searchers
  - individual basic work
  - Point to point collaboration

- Research teams and Labs
  - small groups of searchers : common goal
  - Technical support (resources)
  - Social management
